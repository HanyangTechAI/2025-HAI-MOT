# YOLOv11 VisDrone Fine-Tuning and Evaluation

## üõ†Ô∏è Description

This repository contains a set of Python scripts that perform the following tasks:
1. Download the VisDrone dataset using the provided YAML configuration file from the Ultralytics YOLOv11 repository.
2. Fine-tune the YOLOv11s model on the VisDrone dataset.
3. Compare and evaluate the results before and after fine-tuning.

This setup is useful for anyone interested in experimenting with drone-based object detection using the latest YOLOv11 models.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Languages or Frameworks Used
Main required modules:
- `ultralytics`
    - which includes `torch`, `opencv`, `numpy` and more

All dependencies are listed in `pyproject.toml`
### Installation

**Option 1: Using Poetry**  
This project uses Poetry for dependency management.  
To install dependencies, first make sure Poetry is installed, then run:
